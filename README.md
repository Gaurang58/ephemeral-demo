# 🚀 Azure Ephemeral Test Environment Setup - Progress Report

## 📘 Introduction
This project sets up **ephemeral (temporary) test environments** in Azure for both frontend and backend applications using **GitHub Actions** and **Azure Container Apps**.  
Each Pull Request automatically deploys a **preview environment** that is **deleted when the PR closes**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Create automatic, on-demand test environments for each Pull Request.  
- Deploy frontend and backend containers using Docker Compose configuration.  
- Integrate with Azure Container Apps for hosting ephemeral environments.  
- Enable automated cleanup when the Pull Request is closed.  
- Use secure authentication via OIDC (OpenID Connect) between GitHub and Azure.
